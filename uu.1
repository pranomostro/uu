.TH UU 1
.SH NAME
uu \- unsorted uniq

.SH SYNOPSIS
uu
.br
fnuu
.br
bauu

.SH DESCRIPTION
uu prints only the first occurrence of an input line. The input does
not have to be sorted. Any arguments are ignored.

fnuu is a faster, less memory intensive version of uu with false
negatives (lines that haven't been in the input have a slim chance
not to be printed).

bauu has the same false negatives of fnuu, but uses constant memory
(512MB) and is at least twice as fast as the other two versions.

.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
.fi
.RS
$ echo -e 'naaas\enpaas\enras\enpaas\entaas' | uu | tr '\en' '|'
.br
naaas|paas|ras|taas
.RE
.fi

.SH BUGS
uu uses too much memory.
.PP
fnuu and bauu have too many false negatives.

.IR awk(1).
